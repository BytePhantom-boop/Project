These are the 3 projects for crux inductions 2026, round 1.
I will explain the projects in brief.
First one is a basic habit tracker, just run index.html locally on any device, and it should work, so is the second one.
The third one, it is a student utility web app, there are multiple html files, all are linked to index.html, run that, to access the web app.
